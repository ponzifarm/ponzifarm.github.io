**ponziFarm** is a crypto-based, investment-style game where manipulating the "system" is not only allowed but encouraged! 

Sounds sketchy, right? ðŸ¤£ See [this post](/blog/making-money-with-ponzifarm) to learn why it isn't, and how to make real money playing the game!

Meanwhile, before you get started...

1. **You need a crypto wallet with some funds in it!** In our [testnet preview](https://preview.ponzifarm.com) we support ETH & MATIC on the Goerli & Mumbai testnets. When we [go live](https://ponzifarm.com) you can play with either currency on the related mainnets. More to come... we support [every EVM blockchain](https://coinguides.org/evm-blockchains-add-evm-network/)!

1. **You need MetaMask to play!** You can explore any game in any browser, but to make or withdraw a deposit you'll either need the MetaMask browser extension (on your laptop) or the MetaMask app's built-in browser (on your mobile device). Click [here](https://metamask.io/download/) to install MetaMask. 

Once you have that stuff out of the way, playing **ponziFarm** is simple:

* Visit the current game dashboard on our [testnet preview](https://preview.ponzifarm.com) or the [mainnet site](https://ponzifarm.com).

* ETH is the default currency. Use the dropdown at the top of the page to choose a different one if you like.
