**ponziFarm is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

This release was all about tying things up with a nice little bow. There were a couple of contract changes, but only around the emission of events: not enough to warrant restarting ongoing preview games. Hence the patch version.

In no particular order:

* Games now emit a stats event immediately on game start. This establishes the Day 0 state, which should be zeros across the board.

* Game days are now rounded up instead of down. So any data that comes in after the instant of game start updates Day 1 stats, anything right after the end of Day 1 updates Day 2 stats, and so on. If you're wondering why we didn't do it that way all along, well... so are we. ðŸ¤£ 

**Day 0 Data:** In this release we didn't replace any existing game contracts, and those started _without_ emitting Day 0 stats, so the Game 0 [Game Summary](https://blog.ponzifarm.com/blog/game-summary/) graphs on all Preview blockchains will actually display data from Day 1. Once Game 0 ends, Game 1's graphs will display data from Day 0 as soon as the graphs become visible (right after the start of Day 2).

* We got smarter about how game timers work, both the countdown to the next game and the countUP after game start. TL/DR: when we run games at an accelerated pace in the dev environment, these counters now reflect GAME time instead of REAL time. Nothing you are likely to see, but it's fun to watch.

* We improved the loading of game data to give you better visual cues and a more consistent experience, especially on the All Games page (which you won't see in [Preview](https://app-git-preview-0-6-1-ponzifarm.vercel.app/) until Game 0 ends).

* We came up with a more effective method of running a large number of Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in Preview. This helps us stress-test the system before we go live on the Mainnets. 

**About NPCs...** We will NOT be running NPC accounts on Mainnet games! Why not? Easy: we share management fees with [promotional partners](blog/making-money/#operating-the-game), and our contracts make no provisions for any special player category like NPCs. So that would get VERY expensive, VERY fast!

* We updated a couple of links on the front end.
