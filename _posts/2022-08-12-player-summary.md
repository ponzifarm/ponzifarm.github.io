Once you have deposited to a **ponziFarm** game, the game dashboard will display a summary of your activity and performance in that game.

If the game is live, these stats will be updated in real time as you interact with the game. Once you have generated enough data, this summary will also display interactive graphs of your statistics over the life of the game.

## Player Stats

Player stats are grouped at the top of the Player Summary panel. Hover over a stat to see additional info and a link to documentation. Once charts appear, click a stat to see how it evolves over time.

### Deposits

    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/player-stat-deposits.png" class="shadow">
</figure>

This stat displays a running count of your deposits to the game, as well as the their total value. Charts will appear once you have generated at least three data points. Afterward, click the **Deposits** stat to see a graph of both metrics over time.

### Rebates

</figure>

Deposits with longer lockup periods earn rebates, which are paid instantly back to the depositing account. 

Rebate rates vary from game to game. All game parameters are displayed in the Game Rules panel at the bottom of every game dashboard.

This stat displays a running count of the rebates you have earned in the selected game, as well as their total value. Once charts have appeared, click the **Rebates** stat to see a graph of both metrics over time.

### Referrals

    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/player-stat-referrals.png" class="shadow">
</figure>

Every **ponziFarm** player gets a referral link to share with friends. When your friend makes a deposit to any game, you earn a referral fee, paid instantly to your crypto wallet. Referral fees are shared up the referral chain, so it pays to build a network!

Referral rates and upline cuts vary from game to game. These and other game parameters are displayed in the Game Rules panel at the bottom of every game dashboard.

This stat keeps a running count of the number of direct and indirect referral fees you have earned during this game, as well as their total value. Once charts appear, click the **Referrals** stat to see a graph of both metrics over time.

### Withdrawals

    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/player-stat-withdrawals.png" class="shadow">
</figure>

This stat counts the number of deposits you withdrew from this game at maturity, following expiration of their respective lockup periods. It also keeps a running total of the value of these withdrawals, which includes accumulated daily returns.

Once charts appear, click the **Withdrawals** stat to see a graph of both metrics over the life of the game.

### Ejections

<figure class="align-left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/player-stat-ejections.png" class="shadow">
</figure>

Some **ponziFarm** games permit **ejection**: an early withdrawal of your deposit, prior to the expiration of its lockup period. Ejection can prevent a total loss of your deposit, but it comes at a price: you forfeit all of your deposit's daily returns, and also pay a penalty out of your initial deposit value. So choose wisely!

Ejection availability and the penalty paid vary from game to game. Check the Game Rules panel at the bottom of every game dashboard to see these and other game parameters.

This stat maintains a running count of deposits you have ejected from this game, as well as their total value after accounting for penalties. Once charts appear, click the **Ejections** stat to see a graph of both metrics over time.

### Unsettled

<figure class="align-left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/player-stat-unsettled.png" class="shadow">
</figure>

This stat counts your deposits that remain at risk in this game, along with a running total of their initial values. These numbers will increase when you make a new deposit, and decrease when you withdraw or eject one from the game.

Remember, a game can crash and end very quickly! Pay close attention to these numbers: they measure the assets you still have at risk in the game.

Once charts appear, click the **Unsettled** stat to see a graph of both metrics over time.

### Cleared

<figure class="align-left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">

</figure>

If the game ended _now_, where would you stand? This metric is the answer to that question. When you make a deposit, this value will decrease by the amount of your deposit. When you receive money from the game from withdrawals, ejections, rebates, or referral fees, this number rises.

Your goal is to place this value in positive territory at the end of the game!

Once charts appear, click the **Cleared** stat to see a graph of this metric over time.
