ponziFarm is a work in progress! We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

Release v0.1.6 is preview-only. It will not be visible in production. Visit the live preview [here](https://preview-0-1-6.ponzifarm.com).

We've created a game on each supported coin, and their start times are staggered so you can see the countdown timers operating. You can make deposits and see both the overall game stats and the stats associated with your account.

You can't yet **withdraw** your deposits. (This is fully supported by the back end but not yet by the UI.) Consequently, games in this release won't go broke and end, so you'll only ever see one game per supported coin.

The player-specific stats are still rudimentary. More to come.

Next feature in the queue is the graph that displays the game status over time. This is actually pretty interesting: there will come a point during game play where withdrawals will exceed deposits. This signals the beginning of the crash, and you'll be able to SEE it coming. Hopefully your deposits will unlock before the crash actually arrives! ðŸ˜‰
