**Yielda is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

The primary purpose of this release was to complete our [re-branding](/blog/ponzifarm-is-now-yielda) from PonziFarm to Yielda! This was a big undertaking with a lot of moving parts... but it's done. Hope you like it!

Asize from that, a few bugs came up and we squashed 'em. ðŸ¤£

Next release shouldn't be much more than a week away, and it will be an impoportant one: we'll be adding full, sortable, searchable visibility into every deposit and player in the game, including stats! Think _leaderboard_.

Stay tuned!

_P.S. **Yielda** looks GREAT in the MetaMask mobile app's integrated browser, so you can play right on your phone!_
