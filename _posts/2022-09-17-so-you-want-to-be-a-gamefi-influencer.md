Are you building a social media community at that crossover point where crypto investing meets GameFi? **Let's do business!** 

**Yielda** is an irreverent Web3 social strategy game that is interesting, engaging, provably fair, and insanely profitable. There's real money on the table and the stakes are high! 

Here's what one analyst had to say about it:

> Yielda is the most purely GameFi project I've seen!

**Yielda** is running [live on three testnets](https://preview.yielda.io) right now, but we want to build a community of interest before we launch on the mainnets, hopefully within the next couple of months.

We're looking for social media micro-influencers in the 1-10k follower range to help us have a public conversation about **Yielda** and build an engaged community who will be ready to play when we hit the mainnets!

**TL/DR:** [Email us](mailto:hello@yielda.io) or [DM us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1503576698360676358&text=I%27m%20an%20influencer%20and%20I%20want%20to%20help%20grow%20your%20user%20community%21) and we'll help you get started!  And YES we will actually pay you real money. ðŸ¤£

**Yielda** embraces *radical transparency*. We seek ENGAGEMENT, not ENDORSEMENT!

Ask us hard questions in public. Make us explain ourselves to your satisfaction. Show your followers you mean business. All we ask is an opportunity to impress you and them. 

**If we fail, that's on us!**

## The Deal

We get it: **you don't work for free!** Why should you?

Until we launch on the mainnets, **Yielda** is pre-revenue. But if we launch well, our first mainnet games will make a ton of money! So here's what we are offering:

**You engage us** in a meaningful exchange on your platform, once a week, through our mainnet launch until the end of our first round of mainnet games. We hope to launch in 8-12 weeks, and a typical game lasts 4-8 weeks, so figure somewhere between 12 and 20 meaningful weekly engagements. If we do OUR job right, you'll want more!

**We will grant you** 1% of our management fee for the first game on each mainnet, delivered instantly following each player deposit as described [here](/blog/making-money/#operating-the-game), plus whatever you can earn using our [Referral Program](/blog/referrals). 

**You'll start getting paid the moment the first mainnet player makes a deposit!**

**FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES:** If you help us get through our first nainnet games, then we will ABSOLUTELY engage with you to continue your support across future games, and at a higher rate!
