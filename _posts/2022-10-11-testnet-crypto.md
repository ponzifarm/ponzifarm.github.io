Are you building a Web3 project and need more testnet cash than the faucets provide? Just want to play the [Yielda Testnet Challenge](/blog/testnet-challenge) without wrestling with a testnet faucet? Read on! 

Yielda's testnet preview generates a lot of testnet cash. And we know first-hand that some Web3 projects NEED a lot of testnet cash! So we'll make a deal with you...

**Have a meaningful interaction with [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/yielda_game), and we'll give you some testnet cash!**

_What's a "meaningful interaction"?_ We all know one when we see one. Ask us a question on your Twitter feed, give us an opportinity to answer, maybe ask a follow-up. See [here](/blog/so-you-want-to-be-a-gamefi-influencer/#some-prompts) for some helpful prompts.

_How much will we give you?_ Depends on the network:

* Avalanche Fuji: 10 AVAX
* Ethereum Goerli: 0.5 ETH
* Polygon Mumbai: 2.5 MATIC

That's 5 days' worth of faucet output on each of those networks.

To get your testnet crypto, just mention [@yielda_game](https://twitter.com/yielda_game) on Twitter and start a conversation!
