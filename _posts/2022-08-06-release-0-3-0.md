**ponziFarm is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

This was an exciting release!

We resolved a couple of issues on the smart contract size. There was a corner case involving the calculation of a game's start time if it was created after the previous game ended. We also cleaned up some redundancy in stats reporting, which was nice because it simplified the code base and resulted in somewhat smaller contracts and lower gas fees.

But the MAIN even in this release was the addition of live stats and charts on the front end! Take a look at the preview: you can now select any metric on the game datails page and see the full history of that metric charted across the life of the game! Scroll down a bit and&mdash;if your wallet was a depositor in the game&mdash;you can also see the history of your own performance in the game.

We are REALLY proud of how this looks! 

Of course there is plenty more to do. None of those metrics are actually *explained* anywhere, so we need to add info popups and also links to more descriptive pages here on this blog. And the game details page is still missing some key content: the list of your deposits, along with buttons to let you withdraw a deposit and also eject earlt from a game if you think you're in trouble!

All of that is queued for upcoming releases. Keep an eye out here for more news soon!
