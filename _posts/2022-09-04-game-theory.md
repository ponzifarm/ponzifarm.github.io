[Game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) is a branch of mathematics that studies strategic interactions among rational agents.

Let's compare two very different casino games: [roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette) and [poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker).

## Roulette vs. Poker

In roulette, the outcome of any given bet is entirely a matter of probability. The outcome of a _specific_ bet (_e.g._ black or evens) is not knowable, but two players that each make the _same_ bet a thousand times are likely to wind up in very much the same place. 

Game theory doesn't really apply to roulette, because (with apologies to wishful thinkers) there is _no_ betting strategy that will produce a long-term win at the roulette table. Eventually, the house _always_ wins, and players can make their own decisions without considering the decisions of other players.

Poker is categorically different. While the distribution of cards in a given hand is just as random as the fall of a roulette ball, each player then makes critical decisions _after_ the cards are dealt. Of course a competent poker player takes probability into account... but a _winning_ poker player also accounts for _the state of mind of the other players at the table_.

Poker strategy is _recursive:_ my decisions depend on what I believe you believe I believe about the cards the cards in your hand, and so on. It also has a _memory:_ if you display a pattern in your betting, I might profitably take it into account... unless _your_ pattern is a deliberate attempt to influence _my_ decisions!

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

[_The Prisoner's Dilemma_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a classic example of game theory in action.

Gang members Andy and Bob are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don't have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain. 

Here are the choices available to Andy and Bob, along with their consequences:

| Andy's Choice | Bob's Choice | Andy's Outcome | Bob's Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| silence | silence | 1 year | 1 year |
| silence | betrayal | 3 years | freedom |
| betrayal | silence | freedom | 3 years |
| betrayal | betrayal | 2 years | 2 years |

Assume there will be no further consequences beyond prison time, and no more opportunities to make a deal. In a prisoner's shoes, which would you choose?

If Andy is confident Bob will remain silent, Andy's best option is to betray him. If Bob expects Andy to betray him, Bob's best option is betray Andy as well. But if _both_ remain silent, then _neither_ will suffer the _worst_ outcome.

In practice, there is no certainty about another person's state of mind. And if Andy and Bob are arrested _again_, another factor comes into play: _memory_.

## Iteration Strategies

Say Andy betrays Bob the first time around, while Bob remains silent. Shortly after Bob is released from prison, both are arrested again and offered the same deal.

Will Bob retaliate against Andy's betrayal by betraying Andy in turn? If so, Bob's silence is not an option, and Andy should betray Bob again and accept a two-year sentence instead of three. Freedom for Andy is no longer on the table.

But if Bob and Andy _both_ remain silent—in other words, both decide to play _nice_—they can both get off with a single year.

There's a great deal of depth here. Add more prisoners, more options, and more iterations, and the outcomes quickly get bewilderingly complex, and apparently random...

But not _actually_ random! Remember, there are no dice here, no roulette wheels, no shuffled cards. Just the complexity generated by a [recursive theory of mind](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10458-015-9317-1).

## The Yielda Connection

A quick reminder of how Yielda operates (click [here](/blog/getting-started) for a deeper dive):

* Players deposit money into the game for a fixed lockup period. 

* Every deposit increases the game balance, extending the life of the game in the short term.

* Every deposit also creates an obligation that depletes the game balance _in the future_.

* When the game balance drops to zero, the game ends and all outstanding deposits are lost.

If many players make short-term deposits with low returns, then the game balance will rise slowly and be depleted slowly. **An aggressive player can take advantage of this** to make a large, long-term, very profitable deposit... and confidently expect it to mature before the game ends. The resulting withdrawal at maturity will leave many short-term depositors high and dry. 

But if many other players seize this opportunity to make slightly shorter-term, slightly less profitable deposits, then **the most aggressive player's strategy will fail** and the game will crash before he can execute his withdrawal.

If a few players make long-term deposits with high returns, then the game balance will rise quickly and remain stable for a long time before suddenly crashing. **A cautious player can take advantage of this** to make short-term, low-profit deposits, confidently expecting to collect his profits before the game ends. Enough of these will offset the large depositors' contributions, leaving many of them high and dry before their deposits expire.

But if other players seize this opportunity to make slightly less conservative, slightly more profitable deposits, then **these players will profit at the expense of many of the more conservative players!**

There is no question that **EVERY Yielda game has a winning strategy**. But the _specifics_ of every winning strategy are _completely_ dependent on what every _other_ player thinks is the winning strategy! 

The net result of all this recursion looks a great deal like a classic random walk... except that _none_ of it is random. It is merely so complex that it is impossible for humans to tell the difference.

So as games go, **Yielda** is a great deal more like the Prisoner's Dilemma—and more like poker—than it resembles a game of pure chance like roulette.

There is no source of randomness in **Yielda**. Instead, there is _complexity_, generated by the collective and recursive estimation, on the part of every player, of the state of mind of every other player in the game. 

## Winning at Yielda

Winning at **Yielda** is mechanically simple but operationally complex. 

Mechanically: _make deposits that mature before the game crashes_. But how?

Operationally, the best way to know another player's state of mind is to _influence_ it. Game theory offers two strategies:

* **Collaborate with other players!** Create a pattern of deposits that generates enough confidence in new depositors to extend the game long enough for _your_ deposits to mature.

* **Betray your collaborators!** Make deposits that are slightly more aggressive than theirs—or less, depending on your strategy—so you can cash out at their expense.

Sound horrible? Maybe. But those are the only active strategies on the table.

If the Prisoner's Dilemma and other recursive games teach us anything, it is this: _strategy is amoral_. 

A poker player who never bluffs will not be a poker player for long. And while _playing nice_ is absolutely a valid **Yielda** strategy, it is by no means the only one. 

Now get out there and _win!_
