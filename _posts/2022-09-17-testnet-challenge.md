Ready to have some fun and make come serious coin? Take the **Yielda Testnet Challenge!**

**Yielda** is an irreverent Web3 social strategy game that is interesting, engaging, provably fair, and insanely profitable. There's real money on the table and the stakes are high! 

Here's what one analyst had to say about it:

> Yielda is the most purely GameFi project I've seen!

**Yielda** is launching on the mainnets in just a couple of months. Help us build our user community and stress-test the game ahead of that event, and you can participate in our success!

## The Challenge

Play any Yielda [testnet preview game](https://preview.yielda.io) for free and win an ETH, MATIC, or AVAX income stream from the very next mainnet game! 

Here's how it works:

1. **Follow [@Yielda](https://twitter.com/yielda_game) on Twitter!** We'll only count profits you make while you follow us.

1. **Tweet any of the following** along with your public wallet address:

    * Retweet any [contest announcement](https://twitter.com/yielda_game/status/1574915656973258752?s=20&t=AeS4WIkuqjf5Xf3HTiUrQg).
    
    * Tweet your [referral link](https://blog.yielda.io/blog/referrals) from a [testnet game](https://preview.yielda.io). 
    
    * Tweet a link to [this page](/blog/testnet-challenge).
    
    Don't forget to include your public wallet address! We'll only count deposits you made AFTER you send this tweet.

1. **Play any [Yielda testnet preview](https://preview.yielda.io) game!** These games use testnet cash, so they're free to play. We currently support the ETH, MATIC & AVAX testnets. Be sure to deposit from the wallet you RT'd above!

We'll track your profits. When your testnet game ends, **the top 10 qualified players will get a percentage of the management fee** from the next MAINNET game on the same blockchain. That's real money, folks! 

Our management fees change a bit from game to game, but in the current testnet games they are 10% of every deposit. Here's a breakdown of what the top 10 earners will get from the next mainnet game's overall management fee:

| Top Qualified Player | Mgmt Fee Cut |
| :-: | :-: |
| #1 | 1.0% | 
| #2 | 0.9% | 
| #3 | 0.8% | 
| #4 | 0.7% | 
| #5 | 0.6% | 
| #6 | 0.5% | 
| #7 | 0.5% | 
| #8 | 0.3% | 
| #9 | 0.2% | 
| #10 | 0.1% | 

You'll receive your winnings just like we receive our fees: INSTANTLY following every player deposit to the next mainnet game!

Remember, we are running preview games on THREE testnets. Feel free to enter the **Testnet Challenge** on all three!
