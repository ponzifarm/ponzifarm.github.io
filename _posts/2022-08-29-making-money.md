**Yielda** is a crypto-based, investment-style game where manipulating the "system" is not only allowed but encouraged! It's modeled on a good old-fashioned [Ponzi Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme), a fraudulent (and highly illegal!) investment scam that pays high returns to early "investors" out of the deposits of later ones.

Despite the tongue-in-cheek name, **Yielda** is NOT a scam! The difference is _transparency_. **Yielda** players have complete information concerning the rules of the game, the state of game play, and the activity of other players. Think of it as the ultimate game of stud poker: the challenge is to win the game with ALL of your cards on the table, ALL the time!

There are three ways to make a killing at **Yielda**:

* Play the game and win.
* Recruit new players.
* Help operate the game.

## Playing Yielda

Game play is mechanically simple: _make a [deposit](/blog/deposits)_. 

Each deposit is [locked up](/blog/deposits#lockup-period) for a period of time, and earns a daily rate of return that increases with the lockup period you choose. 

If your deposit matures before the game ends, withdraw your deposit and take a handsome profit. If the game runs out of money before your deposit matures, GAME OVER! Your entire deposit is forfeit!

This sounds simple, but there are hidden depths...

Every new deposit to the game extends the life of the game. You can [watch](/blog/game-summary) the game balance and other metrics develop over time, so you can evaluate the risk of a deposit before you  make one.

Your game play is anonymous by default, but you are encouraged to use social media to talk to other players if you think it might help. Game rules are enforced by smart contracts... but your _behavior_ is not! 

So do your best to manipulate the "market", by any means you can devise. Create a syndicate. Break your promises. Indulge your inner [Bernie Madoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff). Go nuts.

Just remember that every other player will be doing the exact same thing!

We've released **Yielda** with a comprehensive set of metrics designed to help you see through every subterfuge other players might devise. But we haven't thought of _everything!_ That's part of the fun. 

Our job going forward is to listen to our players and create new tools to expose whatever tricks your fellow players dream up. Your job is to get ahead of the curve and _stay_ there.

So do your worst... and then we'll do our best to level the playing field.

**Yielda** is new, and the nuances of game play are still something of a mystery, even to us. But we've done extensive simulation, so here are some principles that we _think_ will get you started as safely as possible:

* **Front-load your deposits!** Early deposits are the safest ones, so try to get into each game as early as possible with your largest deposits.

* **Leverage social media!** Every new deposit buys some time for _your_ deposits to mature, and [referral fees](/blog/referrals) will help defer any losses.

* **Remember your ejection button!** You can pay a penalty to "[eject](/blog/deposits#ejection)" a deposit prior to maturity. You'll take a loss, but it beats losing your whole deposit!

* **Spread your risk!** Every **Yielda** game will eventually crash, but there's a lot of room to maneuver in the middle. Instead of one large deposit, make several smaller ones, with a range of lockup periods. This will _significantly_ reduce the pain of an early ejection!

* **Play the long game!** Every time a **Yielda** game crashes, it is soon followed by a new game. Create referral relationships and forge alliances NOW in order to reduce your losses and enhance your profits LATER. We aren't going anywhere. ðŸ˜‰

## Yielda Referrals

Every new **Yielda** player gets a referral link to share with friends and on social media. This link is permanently connected with the crypto wallet you used to make your deposit.

When a friend clicks your link and makes a deposit, your wallet is permanently designated as their wallet's _upline_. From then on, every **Yielda** deposit from your friend's wallet will generate a referral fee, transferred instantly from the game to your wallet.

If your wallet _also_ has an upline, then this wallet will get a cut of the referral fee you received due to your friend's deposit. This pattern continues up the upline chain until the fee becomes smaller than the gas required to transfer it.

Referral relationships are **permanent**. As long as you keep playing **Yielda**, you will continue to earn referral fees from EVERY player you have referred to the game. So think of referrals as a key element of your social media strategy: eventually, you can take a loss on your deposits and _still_ make a net profit on the game!

As we keep working to enhance game transparency, expect to see metrics that reveal just how well your friends actually perform in the game. Obviously that can work in your favor or against it, so after you refer a new player, consider how you might coordinate your game play. 

Our smart contracts are provably fair. That frees you to play as deviously as you can imagine. So imagine big!

## Operating the Game

We extract a [management fee](/blog/game-rules#management-fee) from a game after every deposit, and we have the ability to share these fees with people (via their crypto wallets) who help us operate the game.

What could you do? Here are some examples:

* Operate our Telegram channel or our Discord server.
* Run an advertising campaign to promote **Yielda**.
* Leverage your status as a social media influencer to grow the **Yielda** community.

Note that this profit sharing is over and above what you might earn through referrals! It is a flat percentage fee, paid instantly following every player deposit to the game you are promoting.

It is also built into the smart contract that represents the game. Why does that matter? Because your participation is PUBLIC... it is just as transparent as any other aspect of the game.

So potential market manipulators beware: this is where we draw the line. EVERYBODY will be watching. ðŸ˜‡
