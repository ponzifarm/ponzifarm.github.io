A **Yielda** player enters a game by making a deposit.

Every **Yielda** game runs on a crypto blockchain, and deposits are made in the blockchain's gas currency. For example, Ethereum blockchain deposits are made in ETH and Polygon deposits are made in MATIC.

Every deposit has an **amount** and a **lockup period**.

## Deposit Amount

You may deposit any amount, so long as it meets the game's minimum deposit requirement. We vary the minumum deposit amount from game to game in order to optimize the player experience. These and other game-specific parameters are called out in the [Game Rules](/blog/game-rules) panel at the bottom of every game dashboard.

## Lockup Period

You may choose any lockup period for your deposit that meets the game's minimum lockup requirement, in whole-day incrememts.

Each deposit earns a rate of return that is compounded daily. This rate depends on the deposit's lockup period: the longer the lockup, the higher the daily rate. Daily compounding adds up quickly, so longer deposits can earn a _significantly_ higher overall return when they mature!

While there is no maximum lockup period, there _is_ a maximum daily rate! This (and the associated lockup period) is another game-specific parameter that veries from game to game. 

**Long Deposit Warning** You can lock up your deposit for as long as you want, but while very long deposits do NOT improve your rate of return, they DO raise the risk of total loss if the game ends before your deposit matures. So be careful!
{: .notice--warning}

Once your deposit's lockup period expires, you can withdraw your initial deposit amount plus earnings from the game. But there's a catch: if the game runs out of money before you withdraw your deposit, then the game ends and your entire deposit is lost forever!

## Instant Rebates

Beyond earning a higher daily rate, there is an additional incentive to choosing a longer lockup period for your deposit: **instant rebates**.

Deposits with longer lockups earn a rebate paid instantly back to the wallet that made the deposit. The amount of this rebate increases with the length of your lockup. We vary rebate parameters from game to game; see the [Game Rules](/blog/game-rules) panel at the bottom of every game dashboard for more info!

</figure>

Instant rebates _do not_ affect your deposit balance of your returns... but they _do_ affect the remaining game balance, so every instant rebate paid brings the game just a little closer to its final crash!

## Ejection

If you are in danger of losing your deposit, you have another option: **ejection**.

If you eject your deposit from the game before your lockup expires, you will forfeit all of your accumulated earnings for that deposit, and also pay a stiff penalty out of your deposit's initial value. So you'll take a loss when you eject... but that's better than losing your deposit entirely!

Ejections are not enabled in every game. When they are, we vary the ejection penalty from game to game to optimize the player experience. See these and other game-specific parameters in the [Game Rules](/blog/game-rules) panel at the bottom of every game dashboard.

## Withdrawal Timing

Neither withdrawals nor ejections happen automatically. It's up to you to track your deposits and withdraw them when their lockups expire.

Don't waste any time doing this! Remember, when the game runs out of money, the game is OVER. Any outstanding deposits are forfeit, even if their lockups have already expired!

## Making a Deposit

The deposit panel is located just under the [game summary](/blog/game-summary) on every game dashboard. The deposit panel will _only_ be visible when a game is in play, so don't look for it once the game ends!

To deposit to a game, you _must_ either [install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download) in your browser or access **Yielda** from the Metamask mobile app.

**Don't Be Surprised!** Making a deposit requires TWO MetaMask transactions. See below for details!

Once you click the Deposit button, making a **Yielda** deposit is a two-step process, requiring TWO transactions. Make sure you complete both!

1. **The first transaction creates the deposit's smart contract.** This one will only cost you gas fees.

2. **The second transaction funds the deposit and registers it with the game.** This one will cost the amount of your deposit, plus some additional gas fees.

### Preset Lockup Period

Depositing is easy with a preset lockup period! There are three options, capturing the minimum daily rate, the maximum, and the midpoint between.

To deposit with a preset lockup, just enter an amount, click the Deposit button, and follow the prompts!

### Custom Lockup Period

Depositing with a custom lockup period is also easy!

Just enter any lockup period greater than the game's minimum, and the deposit panel will automatically calculate your daily rate, cumulative return, and any instant rebate.

Even easier: just click the graph, and your choice will be entered for you!

Either way, once you have entered your lockup period and deposit amount, click the Deposit button and follow the prompts.
