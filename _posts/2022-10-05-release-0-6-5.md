**Yielda is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

This release was all about keeping a promise!

We like to yap about how transparent Yielda is, but truth be told up to now it was a little **difficult** to go examine every deposit in a game. They're all there on the blockchain explorer, but as transparency goes there's a lot of room for improvement there.

Well... problem solved! We've added a new tab in the **Game Summary** section that displays every deposit in the game, sorted & paged exactly the same way your own deposits are in the **My Deposits** section. You can also click a button that will take you to the associated PLAYER's blockchain explorer page.

The deposit list still isn't searchable, but we'll get there soon. Meanwhile we'll also be adding a list of all the players in the game, along with their stats: a LEADERBOARD at last! ðŸ˜Ž

Stay tuned!

_P.S. **Yielda** looks GREAT in the MetaMask mobile app's integrated browser, so you can play right on your phone!_
