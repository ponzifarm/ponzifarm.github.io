**Yielda is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

This was supposed to be our re-branding release, but at the last minute we realized we had two super annoying bugs that were causing the application to crash in the MacOS Safari browser.

Nailed 'em! So if you've been frustrated about that, maybe next time mention it and we'll fix it sooner. ðŸ¤£

Anyway... on to the re-branding! We've already got the logo & palette nailed down, so we should be there by some time this coming week.

_P.S. **Yielda** looks GREAT in the MetaMask mobile app's integrated browser, so you can play right on your phone!_
