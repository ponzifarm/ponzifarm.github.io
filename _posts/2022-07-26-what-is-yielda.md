**Yielda** is a crypto game of nerve and bluster. Real money is on the table and the stakes are high. Strong players will make a killing. Weak ones will lose their shirts.

**Yielda** works just like every [Ponzi scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) ever invented: early players earn their profits from the deposits of later ones. Players are encouraged to recruit their friends. Eventually, deposits dry up and the game crashes, leaving late depositors angrily sucking wind.

Real Ponzi schemes pretend to be *investments* and prey on the greedy and stupid. But **Yielda is completely transparent!** Every aspect of the current game is out in the open. Every previous game is open for inspection. There are no secrets. Everybody knows the deal. And once a game crashes to an end, we start counting down to the next one.
