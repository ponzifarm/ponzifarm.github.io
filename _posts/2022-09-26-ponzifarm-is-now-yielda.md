This has got to be some kind of a record.

Last week we received [an incredible review](/blog/glowing-review) from a senior analyst in the GameFi sector. There was just one catch: he stated in no uncertain terms that the **ponziFarm** name was toxic.

Well, we'd heard that one before. And that review was the straw that broke the camel's back. So, over the past few days, we have...

* Chosen a cool new name and branding.
* Refactored tbe **Yielda** web application & blog to reflect the new look.
* Switched all of our social profiles over to the new branding.

Hell of a week, but it's all done and we are moving forward as Yielda!
