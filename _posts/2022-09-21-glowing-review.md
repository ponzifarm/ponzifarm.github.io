A friend runs a company here on Bali that provides analysis & reviews to investors in the [GameFi](https://builtin.com/blockchain/gamefi) space. He asked his lead analyst to take a look at ponziFarm. 

Here's what he said:

> Took a look at PonziFarm. It's very clever and I like it!
>
> In essence, it's a strategy game, where you can employ various tactics to maximize profits. 
>
> * Placing bets, depending on the nature of the game. 
> * Placing further bets to change the nature of the game.
> * Join teams to improve your chances at winning for all included.
> * Betray the team strategy to win yourself, but keep it a secret.
> * Eject your cash if you're about to lose, but lose all the compounded interest and a chunk of the initial deposit. 
>
> In essence, this is a strategic simulator, where the factors for winning changes with every bet. Seems some form of AI will be added later to adjust the game parameters intelligently. 
>
> PonziFarm gets a chunk of change every time someone places a bet, regardless of the outcome. This can be shared with partners/investors.
>
> Players are encouraged to build up networks due to the referral bonuses. This builds up like a pyramid scheme, where the player at the top earns bonuses from the tier below him and every tier after that. So it's best to be at the top of the referral tree. 
>
> Bottom line: This is a clever game that builds on a very basic case premise in game theory, the [_Prisoner's Dilemma_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). 
>
> Game theory is the science of strategic thinking. It studies how players should act in different situations, in order to maximize the probability for a positive outcome and minimize the negative outcome for themselves or for a group. There are logical/mathematical patterns for these situations, as countless examples of similar situations have been constructed into different game theories. 
>
> This game is a mix of the prisoner's dilemma and the [_Stag Hunt_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt). The latter examines how a group should act, when hunting small game or large game in a competition where the goal is to score the highest (various points and combinations for the small/large animals), in order to win.
>
> If you are looking at this to invest, I would say that it will work. It has a "thrill factor" to it. It's not a passive staking game. It's a race. 
>
> Clever players will know how to bet, based on what the game data tells them. If they have bags, they can sacrifice a smaller portion of their funds to skew the game in the direction they want, in order to gain more than they lose (say invest a losing 20% to throw the numbers off, in order for all shorter bets to win etc).
>
> This game of is really clever! It's the most interesting and engaging DeFi project I’ve seen so far. It’s actually the most truly "GameFi" project I’ve looked at. 
>
> About the name... I’m not so sure the author realizes how badly "ponziFarm" will go down among crypto enthusiasts. Anyone outside of crypto will immediately think “scam”!
>
> He should change it to something that reflects the actual game elements.

Given that the writer is an analyst who has looked at literally HUNDREDS of GameFi projects, this is an extraordinary review!

But it ends on a cautionary note, and this is a piece of feedback we have received from EVERY direction: the "ponziFarm" name is a liability. It isn't that nobody gets the joke. It's just that nobody thinks it is funny.

The best time to rebrand is RIGHT NOW, before we grow any more than we have! So we're already putting together a list of candidate names, which we will be sharing on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ponziFarm) and elsewhere before long. The hope is to get completely through the rebranding process within a couple of weeks.

And this is cool: based on his analyst's review, our friend has told us that his firm will *absolutely* promote ponziFarm (and let us identify them lol) just as soon as we change that awful name!

On it. 🤣
