Every new **ponziFarm** player gets a referral link to share with friends and on social media. This link is permanently connected with the crypto wallet you used to make your deposit.

When a friend clicks your link and makes a deposit, your wallet is permanently designated as their wallet's _upline_. From then on, every **ponziFarm** deposit from your friend's wallet will generate a referral fee, transferred instantly from the game to your wallet.

If your wallet _also_ has an upline, then this wallet will get a cut of the referral fee you received due to your friend's deposit. This pattern continues up the upline chain until the fee becomes smaller than the gas required to transfer it.

While the upline relationship is permanent, each game does eventually end. An ongoing game will only pay a referral fee if the upline wallet has already deposited to _that specific game._ 

So if you want to continue to earn your referral fees, be sure to make a deposit to every game! Even a minimum deposit is enough to guarantee delivery of your referral fees.

**Key Referral Rule** You MUST have already deposited to a game in order to establish new referral relationships or receive referral fees within that game! 
{: .notice--warning}

Referral relationships are blockchain-specific. If you've been playing **ponziFarm** on the ETH blockchain and would like to earn referral fees on the MATIC blockchain, be sure to deposit to a MATIC game and then share your MATIC referral link with the world!

The exact percentage of referral fees and upline cuts will vary from game to game as we seek to optimize the overall player experience. Check the Game Rules panel at the bottom of every game dashboard to see these and other game parameters!
