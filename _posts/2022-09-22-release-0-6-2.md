**Yielda is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

Did you see [this amazing review](/blog/glowing-review) from a prominent GameFi analyst? It concluded with a piece of feedback we've heard more than once: that the **Yielda** name is a liability.

Straw-on-the-camel's-back time: we've made the decision to re-brand! More on that later, but for no this release contains an accumulation of front-end tweaks and bugfixes we made prior to that decision. Our NEXT release will be a total rebranding!

In this release, in no particular order:

* We refactored our API from a tangled plate of spaghetti code into a cool arrangement of abstract coder art. You'll never see that part directly, but if everything keeps working smoothly as our user base scales, this will be one reason why.

* We figured out why page icons weren't showing up in social media post URL previews and fixed that.

* We tweaked various stats displays so the number of decimal places displayed makes a bit nore sense.

* We added [AVAX support](https://preview.yielda.io/avax) to the testnet preview.

* We fixed a bug that was disabling Withdraw & Eject buttons for some MetaMask users.

_P.S. **Yielda** looks GREAT in the MetaMask mobile app's integrated browser, so you can play right on your phone!_
