The Merge is coming! 

The [Ethereum Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) is the most significant update in the history of Ethereum, and people around the world will be partying as it happens around 4am UTC on Thursday, 15 Sep, 2022.

Here's a fun idea for merging EVERY Merge party into ONE Merge party! All you need is your smartphone and [Twitter Live](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-live)!

## TL/DR

There are two ways you can help [**#MergeTheMerge**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MergeTheMerge):

Here it is in 4 easy steps:

1. Fire up your Twitter app, open up a new tweet, and hit the camera button.
