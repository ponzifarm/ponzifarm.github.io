This is either the dumbest idea we have ever had, or the most brilliant. You decide!

The [Ethereum Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) is the most significant update in the history of Ethereum, and as I type it is expected to take place around 4am UTC on Thursday, 15 Sep, 2022.

There will be Merge parties taking place worldwide. So we thought... ***why not merge the Merge?***

## Merging the Merge

Should be easy. Follow these steps:

1. Bring a laptop or a tablet to a Merge party. Hell, use your phone!

1. If you're the first to arrive with the gear, set up a [public Zoom call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHoyrHcIeNM) or [Google Hangout](https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/3111943?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) and tweet the connection URL with [**#MergeTheMerge**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MergeTheMerge).

1. If somebody has already done that, then pick a random tweet off [**#MergeTheMerge**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MergeTheMerge) and connect to _their_ call.

If enough people do this, then almost every Merge party in the world will be connected within just a couple of hops.

Have fun, and happy Merge! ðŸŽ‰
