**Yielda is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

In this release we resolved a smart contract vulnerability that would have permitted a malicious actor to submit unauthorized deposit events to a Game. It wouldn't have affected the actual accounting of your deposits, but it would have totally corrupted the numbers displayed on the front end and probably destroyed your confidence in the game. So definitely worth fixing. ðŸ¤£

We also added some documentation links to this blog, and got a better handle on how we will use this blog (which is a separate web app) to support game documentation requirements going forward.

On the development side, we also created a command-line interface that enables us to script the creation of new games, deposits, withdrawals, etc. Not the sort of thing we will use in production, of course, but it's a development power tool that lets us rapidly put the game state where we need it to support whatever part we are working on.
