Are you building a social media community at that crossover point where crypto investing meets online gambling? **Let's do business!**

PonziFarm is running [live on the testnets](https://preview.ponzifarm.com) right now, but we want to build a community of interest before we launch on the mainnets, hopefully within the next couple of months.

We're looking for social media micro-influencers in the 1-10k follower range to help us have a public conversation about ponziFarm and build an engaged community who will be ready to play when we hit the mainnets!

Do a little clicking around here and you will see that ponziFarm embraces **radical transparency**. In that spirit, we seek **ENGAGEMENT not ENDORSEMENT**!

Ask us hard questions in public. Make us explain ourselves to your satisfaction. Show your followers you mean business. All we ask is an opportunity to impress you and them. If we fail, that's on us!

## The Deal

We get it: *you don't work for free!* Why should you?

Until we launch on the mainnets, ponziFarm is pre-revenue. But if we launch well, our first mainnet games will make a ton of money! So here's what we are offering:

**You engage us** in a meaningful exchange on your platform, once a week, through our mainnet launch until the end of our first round of mainnet games. We hope to launch in 8-12 weeks, and a typical game lasts 4-8 weeks, so figure somewhere between 12 and 20 meaningful weekly engagements. If we do OUR job right, you'll want more!

**We will grant you** 1% of our management fee for the first game on each mainnet, delivered instantly following each player deposit as described [here](/blog/making-money/#operating-the-game), plus whatever you can earn using our [Referral Program](/blog/referrals).

**FUTURE ALERT:** If it turns out that your help was effective in getting is through the first games, then we will ABSOLUTELY engage with you to continue your support across future games, and at a higher rate!
