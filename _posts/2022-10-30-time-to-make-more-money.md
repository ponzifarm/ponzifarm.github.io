When we launched Yielda on the testnets, our first games were configured 10% of the value of each deposit as a management fee. In gambling terms, this corresponds to an overall game [Return to Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Player) (RTP) of 90%.  

As many of our testnet players have pointed out, this is VERY low: the typical online slot-machine game as RTP in excess of 94%. Unlike slots, skill is a *significant* factor in Yielda... but still, we agree that such a low RTP stacks the odds unfairly against our players.

We do reserve the right to vary RTP from game to game, and our intent has always been to close this gap and find an optimal RTP setting. But based on player feedback, we think it makes sense to find a new starting point.

Sooo...

We often observe that Yielda is much more like poker than roulette, the difference being a matter of player skill. So we thought it might make sense to recalibrate Yielda's RTP to equal that of [American Roulette](https://www.gambling.com/casino-games/american-roulette), which is 94.74%.

Our smart contracts won't allow any rules changes to games in progress, so this change will take effect with the NEXT games to begin on the [ETH](https://preview.yielda.io/eth), [MATIC](https://preview.yielda.io/matic), and [AVAX](https://preview.yielda.io/avax) testnets.

The net effect of this should be pretty clear: games should last a little longer, and players will make more money!
