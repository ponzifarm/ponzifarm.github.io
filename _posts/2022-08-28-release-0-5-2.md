**ponziFarm is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

The excitement over [our big live preview release](/blog/release-0-4-1) lasted about 24 hours. Then reality set in.

Of course, this is why we do preview releases: the real world has a ornery texture that no test environment can simulate! ðŸ¤£

When you create or withdraw a deposit on **ponziFarm**â€”think _write_ operationsâ€”we use your browser's MetaMask extension (or the mobile app, if that's where you are) as your gateway to the blockchain. You can configure MetaMask to use whatever RPC or WebSockets endpoints you prefer, and we defer to those choices.

Most people will use a public endpoint for MetaMask, which are often rate-limited and offer dubious performance So for the much more common _read_ operations, we use paid node services like [Infura](https://infura.io/) and [Blast](https://blastapi.io/). These services offer far better performance and more permissive constraints... but they are _still_ constrained. You just have to be working pretty hard to hit those limits.

It took us about five minutes.

The problem was *[eth_getLogs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getlogs)*, which we use to pull the history of state changes and deposits to a game. Our initial implementation was very loose: it just said _give us the entire history of log entries for this game contract_.

Worked just fine in our test environment!

But too loose for the real world. In order to deliver on that request, our RPC had to evaluate _every block in the history of the blockchain_, which gets a new one every fifteen seconds or so. We got one or two of those and hit our daily rate limit.

So we decided to limit our request to the life of the game in question... and immediately hit another problem: _What is the game's starting block number?_ We track a timestamp at game start, and the blick number _is_ derivable from the timestamp, but that's an expensive operation. So we elected to add the starting block to each game contract's state variables. While we were at it we made a few other minor contract changes, all of which account for this version's transition from 0.4.x to 0.5.x.

Still not enough, though. A typical game lasts 30-60 days. At 12 seconds per block, that works out to nearly a half-million blocks, FAR more than the typical request limit of just a few thousand blocks. So we also had to _page_ our requests... and then limit their concurrency to avoid short-term rate limits.

Anyway, we got there. This release minimizes requests and loads historical data as quickly as possible without setting off any alarm bells. Along the way we also switched our Ethereum testnet from Rinkeby to Goerli. Read about [The Merge](https://www.alchemy.com/the-merge) to understand why!

If you poke around, you'll also see that the documentation links in the app now all work and are backed up by actual content. First-draft territory, perhaps, but good enough for a start!

For all you crypto marketers out there, remember: we're looking hard for partners to help us operate our Telegram & Discord channels and promote **ponziFarm** on social media and elsewhere. There's a lot of money to be made there. We'll tell you all about it in a future post!

Meanwhile, please [give **ponziFarm** a try!](https://preview.ponzifarm.com) Just install MetaMask in your browser, click the faucet button to fill your wallet with Testnet crypto, and you'll be ready to make your first deposit!

_P.S. **ponziFarm** looks GREAT in the MetaMask mobile app's integrated browser, so you can play right on your phone!_
