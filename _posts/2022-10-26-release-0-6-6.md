**Yielda is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

Another promise-keeping release!

[Last release](/blog/release-0-6-5) we exposed every deposit to a Yielda game.

This time around we have exposed every **player** in the game. We've also enhanced the controls on both tabs to give a bunch more ways to slice & dice the data.

We also cleaned up the UI a bit to improve the user experience.

We still have a bit of work to do on transparency. Here are the two key upcoming items:

* Some of the metrics are a bit coonfusing. We're going to upgrade these, and also update them continuously so you can see your deposit ROI and overall game performance as they change in real time.

* We'll add a player search box to the Players & Deposits tabs so you can easily narrow the view down to a specific player.

Stay tuned!

_P.S. **Yielda** looks GREAT in the MetaMask mobile app's integrated browser, so you can play right on your phone!_
