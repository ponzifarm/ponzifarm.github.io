**Yielda is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

Pretty excited right now!

This is the release that takes **Yielda** into full preview mode. What does this mean?

* The application is now _fully functional_ on our [Testnet preview](https://preview.yielda.io)! You can deposit to games (and maybe earn instant rebates), withdraw or eject your deposits, and share your referral link for referral fees, just like in the real deal! The only difference is that you are playing with Testnet crypto. 

* We decided to go live initially on just the Ethernet & Polygon networks. This demonstrates our multi-chain capacity, but gives us room to grow while we concentrate early players on just a couple of blockchains. More to come: Yielda supports _every_ EVM-compliant blockchain!

* You'll probably see some players already active on the preview games! Many of these will be _non-player characters_ (NPCs). We created some NPC automation so we could demonstrate the long-term dynamics of game play without recruiting a bunch of drones. NPCs will _not_ be a factor in the Mainnet games. They _can't_... thanks to our promotional relationships, that would cost us an arm and a leg! We'll explain more in a future post.

One note regarding performance. There are two limiting factors:

* **How fast the blockchain responds.** There isn't much we can do about that, so just be aware that the application will feel more snappy at some times of the day than at others.

* **Our choice of web3 library.** We chose [web3.js](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js), which turns out to be WAAAY bigger than it should be, so initial load times are a little slow. Once we are safely into production, we plan to refactor to [ethers.js](https://ethers.org/), which is much smaller and MUCH faster!

So now what? Here's what the next few weeks look like:

* We're paying close attention to the app in Preview while our NPCs shake it our for us.

* We're writing a TON of documentation to back up all those info links in the app!

* We're looking hard for partners to help us operate our Telegram & Discord channels and promote **Yielda** on social media and elsewhere. There's a lot of money to be made there. We'll tell you all about it in a future post!
