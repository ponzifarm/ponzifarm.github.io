**ponziFarm is a work in progress!** We add new features regularly. Whenever we have a stable release, we deploy it first to our supported testnets so we can shake it out before we update our production application.

If you read [our last release notes](/blog/release-0-5-2), you'll know that we altered our contracts to persist the block number at game start, in order to limit the scope of log searches. This produced healthy boosts to both operating costs and performance.

So you'd think it would have occured to us to do exactly the same thing for game END. ðŸ™„

Done.

We fixed a couple of other contract-related things as well, including an annoying defect that allowed deposits _after_ game end... a problem, since the smart contract won't ever allow those deposits to be withdrawn! The front end would have prevented that, but better to tie it off at the contract level.

We also improved performance on the front end, and extended live updating to the All Games page, which appears once the _second_ game starts and reveals the entire game history.

Finally, we acted on some beta-tester feedback and replaced the STARTED & ENDED game stats with [GAME TIME](/blog/game-summary#game-time), which provides a continuous count of time in play.

Every time we make contract changes we create a new minor version and replace all the games in the Preview environment, so apologies to those who were already out there testing: your deposits are still live in the [v0.5.2 Preview environment](https://app-git-preview-0-5-2-ponzifarm.vercel.app/), but the [main Preview](https://preview.ponzifarm.com) has switched to v0.6.0 and if you want to play the latest version you'll have to make new deposits there.

FYI this will ONLY happen in Preview! Once we go live on the mainnets, we'll upgrade contracts rather than replace them and any new changes will just appear without disturbing any existing deposits.

Thanks again to our beta testers for their help. Stay tuned: we'll be going live for reals in just a few more weeks!

_P.S. **ponziFarm** looks GREAT in the MetaMask mobile app's integrated browser, so you can play right on your phone!_
